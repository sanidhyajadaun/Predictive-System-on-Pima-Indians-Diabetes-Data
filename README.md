# ProjectOverview
In this project, we aim to build a predictive system using machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes outcomes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. We employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) as our primary classification algorithm for modeling.

The project involves comprehensive data analysis, visualization, feature preprocessing, and model training. The trained model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The system's accuracy is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy score and confusion matrix.

# Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sanidhyajadaun/Predictive-System-on-Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Data
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the project: python main.py
   
# Usage
Once the project is set up, you can explore and analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using Jupyter Notebooks or any Python IDE. The main code file (main.ipynb) contains the pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code as needed.
